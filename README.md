# Assembly Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

This repository demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in a short assembly code snippet. The vulnerability arises from the lack of bounds checking on an array index, allowing access to memory locations outside the allocated array. This can lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or potential security exploits.

## Vulnerable Code

The `bug.asm` file contains the vulnerable code. It attempts to access an array element using an index calculated from the `ecx` register. Without bounds checking on `ecx`, this index can exceed the array bounds, leading to a buffer overflow.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.asm` file shows how to mitigate this vulnerability by adding bounds checking to ensure that `ecx` remains within the valid range of the array index. This prevention mechanism makes sure the program doesn't try to access memory beyond its allocated space.

## Mitigation

- **Input validation:** Always validate user inputs or external data before using them as array indices.
- **Bounds checking:** Before accessing an array element, verify that the index is within the valid range of the array.
- **Safe functions:** Use safe functions that handle memory allocation and access securely.
- **Memory protection:** Employ operating system features like address space layout randomization (ASLR) and data execution prevention (DEP) to help mitigate the impact of buffer overflows.
